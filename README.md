## Tech Stack:
The current tech stack for this project:

**Frontend**: (Dart + TypeScript)
  - Flutter: Great for cross-platform mobile. Fast dev cycles, smooth UI, single codebase.
  - React & Tailwind: A proven combo for fast, modern UIs on the web.
  - Next.js: SSR, SEO, routing, and API routes built-in.
  - Tauri: Lightweight, secure alternative to Electron. Uses native system webviews ‚Äî perfect for turning SurfBored into a desktop app with minimal overhead.

**Database**: (PostgreSQL + TypeScript)
  - Postgres (via Supabase): Powerful relational model, ideal for structured data like users, posts, comments, and reactions.
  - Supabase Storage with Amazon S3 Bucket: File storage (images)

**Backend**:
- Twillio Verify: Phone number authentication
- Axum: Clean, ergonomic, and fast. Perfect for writing safe, async web APIs.
- Sqlx: Type-safe SQL ‚Äî compile-time checks mean fewer bugs in production. Fantastic with Axum.
- jsonwebtoken: Standard for stateless authentication.
- reqwest: Reliable and async-friendly for external APIs (Gemini, etc.).
- Tauri IPC: Secure IPC means tighter integration with the frontend.
- FCM: Push notifications for mobile
